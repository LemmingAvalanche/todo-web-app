* TODO Crossing out the super list-item makes the sub list-items ilegible

Given this list item with sub-goals:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
- Hit the gym
  - Hit the treadmill
  - Hit the squat rack
#+END_QUOTE

Crossing out the top item (“Hit the gym”) makes sub-goals ilegible.

* TODO Close buttons are not aligned in nested lists

* TODO Use a dialog prompt for inputing sublist item text

Use a popup window (similar to ~alert~) to input the texts for the
subitems.  That way I don’t need to stick an input field into (or under)
the top-level list items.
